The code expects the existence of the following folders:
Ce 80 MeV
Ce 100 MeV
Ce 120 MeV
Ce 140 MeV
Ce 160 MeV
Ce 180 MeV
Ce 200 MeV
Ce 220 MeV
MB 200 MeV (Muscle Only)
MB 200 MeV (Bone Only)
Ph 220 MeV (2 Blocks)
Ph 220 MeV (4 Blocks)
Ph 220 MeV (6 Blocks)

I've tried to generalize the code such that the folders don't have to have these exact names, but I have no guarantee that I've covered all of my bases.
